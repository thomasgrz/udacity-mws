Focus: Task Runners (Grunt) and automation, Image Optimization (GraphicsMagick / Imager)
Learned how to use Grunt, a task runner, to do tasks like image resizing and compression in bulk.

Worked with Imager.js in order to dynamically request and adjust which images are shown on 
index.html based on the viewport size.

Used grunt-responsive-images within Gruntfile.js in order to automate the process of recreating 
resized images based on presets I set (based off arbitrary breakpoints I chose).

Extra:
Worked with the <Figure> and <Figcaption> tags and included social media SVGs (with credit)
What I enjoyed:
It was really cool to work with an automated system like Grunt where it did the bulk
of the legwork by leveraging NPM packages defined in the Gruntfile.js and package.json 
in order to optimize the existing images by resizing and compressing them along with relabeling them
based on their size. I then was able to use the line endings of the new images generated by Grunt 
(grunt-responsive-images package) to leverage Imager.js which streamlined the process of 
optimizing site performance by lazy loading images and then requesting the images that best fit 
the size of the current viewport upon load and resizing of it.
